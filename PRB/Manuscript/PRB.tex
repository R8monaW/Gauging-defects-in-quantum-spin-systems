\section{Background}\label{S:defs}
In this section, we provide all the definitions and notation that are used throughout the subsequent computations. We will first have to specify the kinematics of quantum spin chains with defects. Afterwards, we will allow the defects to become mobile by the action of a local Hamiltonian. By investigating the simple example of Kitaev's toric code \cite{Kit03} we will show that this is an intricate combinatorial problem, which motivates to make use of alternative ways to describe kinematics. We will therefore use the language of category theory in order to overcome complications. We will familiarize the reader with this language by not giving exhaustive details and explanations whenever it is not necessary for this work but instead referring to the literature where those can be found.

\section{Conclusion}\label{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented an exhaustive case study of a dynamical theory for defects in a one-dimensional spin chain with $\Vec(\Z/2\Z)$ fusion rules. The framework we establish can easily be extended to make sense of defect gauging in more general quantum (spin) systems. Whereas the kinematical theory can be built from distinguishable Fock space, dynamics are generally harder to implement. In order to perform this task we use a description via the ground eigenspace of a specific Hamiltonian. This reduces the problem to a combinatorial one, which can be handled by techniques from annular categories.

In our particular example of a $\Vec(\Z/2\Z)$ spin chain, allowing the presence of defects and fixing the boundary results in the Hamiltonian of the transverse Ising model and, hence, gives rise to a critical theory.

Since our approach is not only restricted to one-dimensional systems it would be interesting to study higher dimensional models, such as the Toric code, and add defects in this more general situation. Another interesting setting is to insert fusion categories with different fusion rules than $\Vec(\Z/2\Z)$ (e.g.\ the Fibonacci category) to our method. Even in this case, it provides a framework to build physical models with dynamically evolving defects. These theories can describe topological phases with more computational power than their counterparts without defects and are, therefore, more convenient for quantum information processing tasks.
