The goal of this work is to build a dynamical theory of defects for quantum spin systems. This is done by explicitly giving an exhaustive case study of a one-dimensional spin chain with $\Vec(\Z/2\Z)$ fusion rules, which can easily be extended to more general settings. A kinematic theory for an indefinite number of defects is first introduced exploiting \emph{distinguishable Fock space}. Dynamics are then incorporated by allowing the defects to become mobile via a microscopic Hamiltonian. This construction is extended to topologically ordered systems by restricting to the ground state eigenspace of Hamiltonians generalizing the \emph{golden chain}. Technically, this is done by employing generalized tube algebra techniques to model the defects in the chain. We illustrate this approach for the $\Vec(\Z/2\Z)$ spin chain, in whose case the resulting dynamical defect model is equivalent to the critical transverse Ising model.
