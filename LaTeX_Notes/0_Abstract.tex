The goal of this work is to build a dynamical theory of defects in quantum spin systems. We construct a kinematic theory using the concept of distinguishable Fock space and incorporate dynamics by methods of topologically ordered systems. This allows us to efficiently study spin chains with the presence of defects. We examine the example of a spin chain with $\Vec(\Z/2\Z)$ fusion rules, where we use generalized tube algebra techniques to model the defects in the chain, which results in the critical transverse Ising model.
