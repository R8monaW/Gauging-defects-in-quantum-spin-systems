The goal of this work is to build a dynamical theory of defects in quantum spin systems. We construct a kinematic theory using the concept of distinguishable Fock space and incorporate dynamics by methods of topologically ordered models. This allows us to e.g. efficiently study spin chains with the presence of defects. We examine the example of a spin chain with $\Vec(\Z/2\Z)$ fusion rules which surprisingly results in the critical transverse Ising model.
