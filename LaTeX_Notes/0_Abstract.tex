The goal of this work is to build a dynamical theory of defects in quantum spin systems. We construct a kinematic theory using the concept of distinguishable Fock space. Dynamics are incorporated by methods of topologically ordered systems using the ground state of a specific Hamiltonian. This allows us to efficiently study spin chains with the presence of defects. We examine the example of a spin chain with $\Vec(\Z/2\Z)$ fusion rules, where we use generalized tube algebra techniques to model the defects in the chain, which results in the critical transverse Ising model.
