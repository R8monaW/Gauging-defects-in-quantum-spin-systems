\subsection{Example: $\Vec(\Z/2)$ spin chain}

We consider a one-dimensional spin chain of $N$ particles, where each particle can be in the spin-up state or in the spin-down state, i.e., a chain
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
			\fill[black] (0,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\fill[black] (0.5,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\fill[black] (1,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\fill[black] (1.5,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\fill[black] (2,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\fill[black] (2.5,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\fill[black] (3,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\fill[black] (4,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\node at (3.5,0) {$\dots$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}
\noindent
whose Hilbert space is 
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{H}_0=\bigotimes_{i=1}^N \mathbb{C}^2.
	\end{equation}
We now introduce defects, which means that one of the spins, say the spin at site $j$, is replaced by a different kind of spin, e.g., no spin (indicated in red): 
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
			\fill[black] (0,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\fill[black] (0.5,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\fill[black] (1,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\fill[black] (1.5,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\fill[red] (2,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\fill[black] (2.5,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\fill[black] (3,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\fill[black] (4,0) circle (0.07cm);
			\node at (3.5,0) {$\dots$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}
\noindent
This corresponds to replacing the Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^2$ at site $j$ with $\mathbb{C}$, which results in the overall Hilbert space
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{H}_1^{(j)}=\left(\bigotimes_{i=1}^{j-1}\mathbb{C}^2\right)\otimes\mathbb{C}\otimes\left(\bigotimes_{i=j+1}^N\mathbb{C}^2\right).
	\end{equation}
The subscript here denotes the number of defects in the chain and the superscript indicates at which site the defect appears. If we want to consider both possibilities, having no defect and having a defect at site $j$, we use the Hilbert space
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_0\oplus\mathcal{H}_1^{(j)}.
	\end{equation}
We can also allow the defect to move, which means we still restrict the setting to only one defect in total, but it can happen at any site. Hence, the overall Hilbert space becomes
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_0\oplus\left(\bigoplus_{j=1}^N\mathcal{H}_1^{(j)}\right).
	\end{equation}
This construction can be generalized to an arbitrary number of defects: The Hilbert space for having defects two defects in the chain, say at sites $j$ and $k$, is 
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{H}_2^{(j,k)}=\left(\bigotimes_{i=1}^{j-1}\mathbb{C}^2\right)\otimes\mathbb{C}\otimes\left(\bigotimes_{i=j+1}^{k-1}\mathbb{C}^2\right)\otimes\mathbb{C}\otimes\left(\bigotimes_{i=k+1}^{N}\mathbb{C}^2\right).
	\end{equation}
Again, if we allow these defects to move and also include the possibilities of having only one defect and no defect at all, the overall Hilbert space is
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_0\oplus\left(\bigoplus_{j=1}^N\mathcal{H}_1^{(j)}\right)\oplus\left(\bigoplus_{j=1}^N\bigoplus_{k\neq j}\mathcal{H}_2^{(j,k)}\right).
	\end{equation}
We can continue this construction until we have a defect at every site of the chain, i.e.
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{H}_N=\bigotimes_{i=1}^N\mathbb{C},
	\end{equation}
and the overall Hilbert space is then
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{H}=\bigoplus_{n\in\#\mathrm{defects}}\mathcal{H}_n,
	\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{H}_n$ is the direct sum of all possible Hilbert spaces with $n$ defects, as constructed above. Since this is now a very complicated Hilbert space, we can also think about it in a different and simpler way: at each site, the particle can be in one of three states: spin up, spin down, or no spin. Hence, we have effectively a three-level system at each site of the chain, and therefore the overall Hilbert space can be written as
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{H}\cong\bigotimes_{j=1}^N\left(\mathbb{C}\oplus\mathbb{C}^2\right).
	\end{equation}

We will now look at the example of a particle chain with $\Vec(\Z/2)$ fusion rules, i.e.\ the objects are either $0$ or $1$ and the fusion is given by addition $\mathrm{mod}\ 2$. We consider the following chain:
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\draw (-0.25,0) -- (8.25,0);
			\draw (0.5,0) -- (0.5,1);
			\draw (1.5,0) -- (1.5,1);
			\draw (2.5,0) -- (2.5,1);
			\draw (3.5,0) -- (3.5,1);
			\draw (4.5,0) -- (4.5,1);

			\node at (6,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
			\node at (7,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
			\node at (8,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}
\noindent
where the bullets can either be $0$ or $1$ (according to the fusion rules), hence each bullet represents the space $\mathbb{C}^2$.
If we only fuse $1$-particles to the chain, the value of the bullets is fixed by the fusion rules: When we fix the outer labels (e.g., to $1$), the only possible labeling is
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\draw (-0.25,0) -- (8.25,0);
			\draw (0.5,0) -- (0.5,1);
			\draw (1.5,0) -- (1.5,1);
			\draw (2.5,0) -- (2.5,1);
			\draw (3.5,0) -- (3.5,1);
			\draw (4.5,0) -- (4.5,1);
			\draw (5.5,0) -- (5.5,1);
			\draw (6.5,0) -- (6.5,1);

			\node at (7,-0.3) {$0$};
			\node at (8,-0.3) {$1$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}
\noindent
Hence, we have a unique ground state and the only vertices occurring in this case are
	\begin{figure}[H]	
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\draw (0,0) -- (1.5,0);
			\draw (0.75,0) -- (0.75,1);

			\node at (1.5,-0.3) {$0$};
			\node at (0.75,1.3) {$1$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}
\noindent
Analogously, if we only allow $0$s to fuse to the chain, and the outer labels are fixed to $1$, the only possible labeling is 
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw (-0.25,0) -- (8.25,0);
		\draw (0.5,0) -- (0.5,1);

		\draw (2.5,0) -- (2.5,1);
		\draw (3.5,0) -- (3.5,1);

		\node at (6,-0.3) {$1$};
		\node at (7,-0.3) {$1$};
		\node at (8,-0.3) {$1$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}
	\noindent
If we had fixed the outer labels to $0$, all bullets would have to be $0$. Hence, the only vertices occurring in these cases are
	\begin{figure}[H]	
		\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw (0,0) -- (1.5,0);
		\draw (0.75,0) -- (0.75,1);
		\node at (0,-0.3) {$0$};
		\node at (1.5,-0.3) {$0$};
		\node at (0.75,1.3) {$0$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\hspace{20pt}
		\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw (0,0) -- (1.5,0);
		\draw (0.75,0) -- (0.75,1);
		\node at (0,-0.3) {$1$};
		\node at (1.5,-0.3) {$1$};
		\node at (0.75,1.3) {$0$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}
\noindent
This means that in the case of open boundary conditions, the chain has a \emph{unique ground state} once we fix the outer labels of the chain. The situation is different for periodic boundary conditions: since the only requirement here is that the label at site $n+1$ has to equal the label at site $1$, there are always two possibilities of labeling the chain. For instance, in the case of only fusing $1$s to the chain, the two possibilities are
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
			\def\Radius{1cm}
			\draw (0,0) circle[radius=\Radius];
			\draw
			\foreach \a in {0, 30, ..., 330} {
				(\a:\Radius) -- (\a:1.4)
			};
			\foreach \a in {0, 30, ..., 330} {
				\node at (\a:1.55) {$1$};
			};
			\foreach \a in {45, 105, ..., 375} {
				\node at (\a:0.85) {$0$};
			};
			\foreach \a in {15, 75, ..., 315} {
				\node at (\a:0.85) {$1$};
			};
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\hspace{40pt}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
			\def\Radius{1cm}
			\draw (0,0) circle[radius=\Radius];
			\draw
			\foreach \a in {0, 30, ..., 330} {
				(\a:\Radius) -- (\a:1.4)
			};
			\foreach \a in {0, 30, ..., 330} {
				\node at (\a:1.55) {$1$};
			};
			\foreach \a in {45, 105, ..., 375} {
				\node at (\a:0.85) {$1$};
			};
			\foreach \a in {15, 75, ..., 315} {
				\node at (\a:0.85) {$0$};
			};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}
\noindent
In case of fusing $0$ to the chain, we can either allow only $0$s or only $1$ as labels of the chain. Therefore, the chain with periodic boundary conditions has two ground states, hence it represents a qubit.

We will now introduce defects to this model, indicated by red lines that fuse to the chain, e.g.\ a chain with one defect would be
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw (-0.25,0) -- (8.25,0);
		\draw (0.5,0) -- (0.5,1);
		\draw (1.5,0) -- (1.5,1);
		\draw (2.5,0) -- (2.5,1);
		\draw[red,line width=0.4mm] (3.5,0) -- (3.5,1);
		\draw (4.5,0) -- (4.5,1);
		\draw (5.5,0) -- (5.5,1);
		\draw (6.5,0) -- (6.5,1);

		\node at (1,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
		\node at (2,-0.3) {$\bullet$};

		\node at (5,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
		\node at (6,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
		\node at (7,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
		\node at (8,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}
	\noindent
Since the chain is represented by a category, $\Vec(\Z/2)$ in our example, the defect is a $\Vec(\Z/2)-\Vec(\Z/2)$ bimodule, i.e.\ we are fusing an object from the bimodule to the chain. Here, we will use the bimodule $F_1$ to introduce defects to the $\Vec(\Z/2)$-chain. $F_1$ has only one object, so in general we omit writing labels for the bimodule object, but indicate by a red line when the object is from the bimodule. When it is inevitable to indicate the label, we denote it $*$.

The occurrence of one defect in a chain does not change the ground state of the system; The labels on the chain are still determined by the choice of labels on the boundary. This is different if we have more than one defect in the chain. For instance, for two defects the chain is
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw (-0.25,0) -- (8.25,0);
		\draw (0.5,0) -- (0.5,1);
		\draw (1.5,0) -- (1.5,1);
		\draw (2.5,0) -- (2.5,1);
		\draw[red,line width=0.4mm] (3.5,0) -- (3.5,1);
		\draw (4.5,0) -- (4.5,1);
		\draw (5.5,0) -- (5.5,1);
		\draw[red,line width=0.4mm] (6.5,0) -- (6.5,1);
		\draw (7.5,0) -- (7.5,1);
		\node at (0,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
		\node at (1,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
		\node at (2,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
		\node at (3,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
		\node at (4,-0.3) {{\color{orange}$\bullet$}};
		\node at (5,-0.3) {{\color{orange}$\bullet$}};
		\node at (6,-0.3) {{\color{orange}$\bullet$}};
		\node at (7,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
		\node at (8,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}
\noindent
where the colour of the orange bullets is not determined by the labels on the boundary of the chain. Hence, we get an additional qubit. In general, the number of additional qubits in the chain is $\#\mathrm{defects}-1$. This can be done analogously for the chain with periodic boundary conditions, the only difference is that in this case, we already have one qubit when there is no defect. By introducing defects to the chain, we have also introduced a new vertex to our model
	\begin{figure}[H]	
		\begin{tikzpicture}
		\draw (0,0) -- (1.5,0);
		\draw[red,line width=0.4mm] (0.75,0) -- (0.75,1);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}
\noindent
where any object from $\Vec(\Z/2)$ can be on the black lines. Since this vertex is neither defined in the category $\Vec(\Z/2)$ nor in the bimodule $F_1$, we need to construct it. More precisely, for each choice of labels we need a basis for the corresponding morphism space. We could also allow the bimodule object to live on the horizontal lines of the chain, which would require the construction of additional vertices. For now, we will restrict to the case that only objects of the category are allowed to be on horizontal lines, but we will come back to other possibilities later. We do the construction of the required vertex step-by-step in the following by using ideas from tube algebras. 

\subsection*{Step 1: Compute isomorphism classes of objects and pick a representative} In general, what we aim for are representations of the tube algebra of the form
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2]
			\draw (0,0) circle (0.5cm);
			\draw
			\foreach \a in {-60, -120} {
				(\a:0.5) -- (\a:1.6)
			};
			\draw[red,line width=0.4mm] (90:0.5) -- (90:1.6);
			\draw ([shift=(-60:1cm)]0,0) arc (-60:90:1cm);
			\draw ([shift=(-120:1.15cm)]0,0) arc (-120:-60:1.15cm);
			\draw ([shift=(240:0.85cm)]0,0) arc (240:90:0.85cm);
			\node at (0.2,-0.2) {$b$};
			\node at (-0.2,-0.2) {$a$};
			\node at (-1,-1.6) {$a+x+y$};
			\node at (1,-1.6) {$b+y+z$};
			\node at (-1,0.3) {$x$};
			\node at (1.15,0.3) {$z$};
			\node at (0,-1.3) {$y$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}
\noindent
According to the figure above, $(*,a,b)\cong(+,a+x+y,b+y+z)$ for all possible labels $x,y,z$, so we pick $(*,0,0)$ as a representative.

\subsection{Step 2: Find primitive idempotents} To find a representation of the tube algebra, we need to compute the primitive idempotents, i.e. we need to find morphisms that map $(*,0,0)$ to $(*,0,0)$ which square to themselves and are orthogonal to each other. Additionally, since we want \emph{primitive} idempotents, we need to make sure that they cannot be written as the sum of idempotents.
The two candidates for idempotents is the morphism where $x+y=0$ and $y+z=0$:

Hence, the second candidate does not square to itself but to the negative of the first candidate. However, since the primitive idempotents form an algebra, we can also consider linear combinations of the candidates. Also, because we have two candidates, we know that the algebra is $2$-dimensional. To find out the primitive idempotents from the candidates, it is convenient to find a representation of them in terms of matrices, i.e.\ we need matrices that multiply in the same way as the candidates. As mentioned above, the first candidate is the identity, hence the corresponding matrix is
	\begin{equation}
		M_0=\begin{pmatrix}
			1 & 0\\
			0 & 1\\
		\end{pmatrix}.
	\end{equation}
From this representation it is clear that this candidate is an idempotent, but not a primitive one: $M_0$ can be written as
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq_M0}
		M_0=\begin{pmatrix}
			1 & 0\\
			0 & 1\\
		\end{pmatrix}
		=\begin{pmatrix}
			1 & 0\\
			0 & 0\\
		\end{pmatrix}
		+\begin{pmatrix}
			0 & 0\\
			0 & 1\\
		\end{pmatrix}.
	\end{equation}
The matrix representing the second candidate has to fulfil $M_1^2=-M_0$, so a possible choice is
	\begin{equation}
		M_1=\begin{pmatrix}
			-i & 0\\
			0 & i\\
		\end{pmatrix}.
	\end{equation}
From \eqref{eq_M0}, we get two candidates for primitive idempotents, $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0\\ \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1\\ \end{pmatrix}$. They are indeed primitive idempotents in the algebra of $2$-dimensional matrices. To translate them back into tube algebra diagrams, we just need to express them in terms of $M_0$ and $M_1$, which yields
	\begin{align}
		\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0\\ \end{pmatrix}&=\frac{1}{2}\left( \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1\\ \end{pmatrix}+i \begin{pmatrix} -i & 0\\ 0 & i\\ \end{pmatrix}\right)\equiv P_+\\
		\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1\\ \end{pmatrix}&=\frac{1}{2}\left( \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1\\ \end{pmatrix}-i \begin{pmatrix} -i & 0\\ 0 & i\\ \end{pmatrix}\right)\equiv P_-,
	\end{align}
which is diagrammatically

\subsection*{Step 3: Check for isomorphism classes of primitive idempotents} In general, it is possible that the primitive idempotents we just found are isomorphic to each other, which means that there are matrices within the algebra that we can multiply to $P_+$, for example, and get $P_-$. The following equation is an example for how this works:
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0\\ 1 & 0\\ \end{pmatrix}P_+ \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1\\ 0 & 0\\ \end{pmatrix}=P_-.
	\end{equation}
However, the two matrices we multiply $P_+$ with are not elements of the matrix algebra (the matrices on the algebra only have entries on the diagonal). If they were elements of the algebra, they would form an isomorphism between $P_+$ and $P_-$ and we had to pick only one of the primitive idempotents.

This step can be much more complicated for algebras with bigger dimensions. However, there is a nice trick which helps to see how many isomorphism classes there are, which is the Artin-Wedderburn theorem. It states that if the matrix algebra can be written as a sum of full matrix algebras, i.e.
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{M}\cong\bigoplus\mathcal{M}_d,
	\end{equation}
then we only get one primitive idempotent for each full matrix algebra. In our example, this is 
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{M}=\mathbb{C}\oplus\mathbb{C},
	\end{equation}
so we get two primitive idempotents (as we showed above). In case of a $5$-dimensional matrix algebra, the decomposition is
	\begin{equation}
		\mathcal{M}_{5-\mathrm{dim}}=\mathbb{C}\oplus\mathcal{M}_2(\mathbb{C}),
	\end{equation}
so we only get two primitive idempotents here although the space is $5$-dimensional.
	
\subsection*{Step 4: Build the full representation} After we have found the primitive idempotents of the algebra, we can build the full representation. This is done by putting all possible tubes on the outside of the idempotents, hence finding all the basis vectors for this space, i.e.\ all possible vectors
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1]
		\draw (0,0) circle (0.5cm);
		\draw
		\foreach \a in {-60, -120} {
			(\a:0.5) -- (\a:1.6)
		};
		\draw[red,line width=0.4mm] (90:0.5) -- (90:1.6);
		\draw ([shift=(-60:1cm)]0,0) arc (-60:90:1cm);
		\draw ([shift=(-120:1.15cm)]0,0) arc (-120:-60:1.15cm);
		\draw ([shift=(240:0.85cm)]0,0) arc (240:90:0.85cm);
		\node at (0.2,-0.2) {$0$};
		\node at (-0.2,-0.2) {$0$};
		\node at (-0.9,-1.6) {$x+y$};
		\node at (0.9,-1.6) {$y+z$};
		\node at (-1,0.3) {$x$};
		\node at (1.15,0.3) {$z$};
		\node at (0,-1.35) {$y$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}
\noindent
In general, the basis vectors are determined by the choice of $x,y$ and $z$, therefore there are up to $2^3=8$ possible basis vectors. However, it is possible that some of these vectors are the same, which is the case in our example, as we will see. Putting the general tubes around the primitive idempotents $P_\pm$ yields
	\begin{equation*}
		\frac{1}{2}\left(
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1,baseline=(current bounding box.center)]

		\end{tikzpicture}

			\draw ([shift=(-60:1cm)]0,0) arc (-60:90:1cm);

			\node at (0,-1.35) {$y+1$};
		\end{tikzpicture}\right),
	\end{equation*}
which is a vector in the morphism space
	\begin{figure}[H]	
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\draw (0,0) -- (1.5,0);
			\draw[red,line width=0.4mm] (0.75,0) -- (0.75,1);

			\node at (1.7,-0.3) {$y+z$};
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}

We now have to find a basis for every one of those morphism spaces, i.e.\ for every choice of $x+y$ and $y+z$. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $x+y=0$, $y+z=0$: There are two possible choices for $x,y,z$ that fulfil this condition. The first one, $x=y=z=0$, yields the vector

		so we have a potentially $2$-dimensional morphism space. However, since
			\begin{equation*}
				V_2=\mp i\ V_1,
			\end{equation*}
		the two candidates are linear dependent, hence we have a $1$-dimensional morphism space and we pick $V_1$ as the basis vector for this space, i.e.\ for future computations, we define

\subsection*{Step 5: Find action of the category on the vertex} After the vertex itself is defined, we want to compute the left and right action of the category on it. Let us first investigate which maps we are actually interested in in the context of our spin chain example. What we finally want to do is define a Hamiltonian for the chain. Diagrammatically, this will be of the form
	\begin{equation*}
		\alpha\ \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1,baseline=(current bounding box.center)]
			\draw [red, line width=0.25mm] (0,0) -- (0,1);
			\draw [red, line width=0.25mm] (0.5,0) -- (0.5,1);
		\end{tikzpicture}
		+\beta\ \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1,baseline=(current bounding box.center)]
			\draw [red, line width=0.25mm] (0,0) -- (0,1);
			\draw [red, line width=0.25mm] (0.5,0) -- (0.5,1);
			\draw (0,0.5) -- (0.5,0.5);
		\end{tikzpicture}\ .
	\end{equation*}
To deal with the second term of the Hamiltonian on the spin chain, we want to do transformations of the form
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1,baseline=(current bounding box.center)]
			\draw (-0.25,0) -- (1.25,0);
			\draw [red, line width=0.25mm] (0,0) -- (0,1);
			\draw [red, line width=0.25mm] (1,0) -- (1,1);
			\draw (0,0.5) -- (1,0.5);
		\end{tikzpicture} \hspace{10pt}\rightarrow\hspace{10pt}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1,baseline=(current bounding box.center)]
			\draw (-0.25,0) -- (1.25,0);
			\draw [red, line width=0.25mm] (0,0) -- (0,1);
			\draw [red, line width=0.25mm] (1,0) -- (1,1);
			\draw (0,0.5) to [bend left] (0.4,0);
			\draw (1,0.5) to [bend right] (0.6,0);
		\end{tikzpicture} \hspace{10pt}\rightarrow\hspace{10pt}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1,baseline=(current bounding box.center)]
			\draw (-0.25,0) -- (1.25,0);
			\draw [red, line width=0.25mm] (0,0) -- (0,1);
			\draw [red, line width=0.25mm] (1,0) -- (1,1);
			\draw ([shift=(180:0.15cm)]0.55,0) arc (0:180:0.15cm);
			\draw ([shift=(180:0.15cm)]1.05,0) arc (0:180:0.15cm);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{equation*}
which means that we need the maps
	\begin{align*}

		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{align*}
For the following computations we will always use the $+$-representation of the vertex. (This calculation can be done analogously with the $-$-representation.) We use the following relation:
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2,baseline=(current bounding box.center)]
			\draw (0,0) to node [left] {$a$} (0,1);
			\draw (0.5,0) to node [right] {$b$} (0.5,1);
		\end{tikzpicture}=\sum_c\ \sqrt{\frac{d_c}{d_a d_b}}\ 
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2,baseline=(current bounding box.center)]
			\draw (0,0) to node [left] {$a$} (0.25,0.25);
			\draw (0.5,0) to node [right] {$b$} (0.25,0.25);
			\draw (0,1) to node [left] {$a$} (0.25,0.75);
			\draw (0.5,1) to node [right] {$b$} (0.25,0.75);
			\draw (0.25,0.25) to node [right] {$c$} (0.25,0.75);
		\end{tikzpicture}.
	\end{equation}
For the black strings in our diagrams, the sum has only one term and the coefficients are all $1$, which yields the relation
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:completeness}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2,baseline=(current bounding box.center)]
			\draw (0,0) to node [left] {$a$} (0,1);
			\draw (0.5,0) to node [right] {$b$} (0.5,1);

			\draw (0.25,0.25) to node [right] {$a+b$} (0.25,0.75);

\subsection*{Step 6: Check if $F$-symbols obey the pentagon equation} To check whether the maps that we have just defined obey the pentagon equation, we need the full set of $F$-symbols. This means that, in addition to the vertex we have just computed, we also need to compute the vertex
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\draw[red,line width=0.4mm] (0,0) -- (1.5,0);
			\draw (0.75,0) -- (0.75,1);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}
\noindent
Doing the same steps as above yields
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1,baseline=(current bounding box.center)]
			\draw[red,line width=0.4mm] (0,0) -- (1.5,0);
			\draw (0.75,0) to node[near end, right] {$\mu$} (0.75,1);
		\end{tikzpicture}=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{x,y}(-1)^{\mu y}
		\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1,baseline=(current bounding box.center)]
			\draw (0,0) circle (0.5cm);
			\draw[red,line width=0.4mm]
			\foreach \a in {-60, -120} {
				(\a:0.5) -- (\a:1.6)
			};
			\draw (90:0.5) to node[near end, right] {$\mu$} (90:1.6);
			\draw ([shift=(-60:1cm)]0,0) arc (-60:90:1cm);
			\draw ([shift=(-120:1.15cm)]0,0) arc (-120:-60:1.15cm);
			\draw ([shift=(240:0.85cm)]0,0) arc (240:90:0.85cm);
			\node at (0.2,-0.2) {$0$};
			\node at (-0.2,-0.2) {$0$};
			\node at (-1,0.3) {$x$};
			\node at (1.15,0.3) {$x$};
			\node at (0,-1.35) {$y$};
		\end{tikzpicture}.
	\end{equation*}
Using all the vertices we have defined enables us to calculate the whole set of $F$-symbols:
	\begin{align*}
		\left(F_{abc}^{a+b+c}\right)_{a+b,b+c}&=1\\
		\left(F_{ab*}^*\right)_{a+b,*}&=1\\
		\left(F_{a*b}^*\right)_{*,*}&=(-1)^{ab}\\
		\left(F_{*ab}^*\right)_{*,a+b}&=1\\
		\left(F_{a**}^{a+b}\right)_{*,b}&=1\\
		\left(F_{*a*}^b\right)_{*,*}&=(-1)^{ab}\\
		\left(F_{**a}^{a+b}\right)_{b,*}&=1\\
		\left(F_{***}^*\right)_{a,b}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1)^{ab},
	\end{align*}
which happen to be the $F$-symbols for the Ising category. 

We now want to build a chain out of $\Vec(\Z/2)$ and the bimodule $F_1$ that corresponds to the Ising model.
